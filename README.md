### Hey I'm Tycho a.k.a. Chimplement!

I am an enthusiastic self-taught software developer with a passion for programming things, from hacking tools to games and simulations. My favorite languages/tools include Python, C, Rust, and Godot. I love learning new things about computers and cybersecurity.

#### These are the most used languages in my public repositories:
