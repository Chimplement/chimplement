### Hey I'm Tycho a.k.a. Chimplement!

I am an enthusiastic self-taught software developer with a passion for programming things, from simulations and games to tools and algorithms. My favorite languages/tools include Python, C, C++, and Godot. I love learning new things about computers as well as other technologies.

#### These are the most used languages in my public repositories:
